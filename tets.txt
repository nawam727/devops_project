Yes, it's absolutely okay to allocate different sizes for the root and home directories in your Kali Linux installation. In fact, it's a common practice to separate these directories to manage disk space more effectively.

Typically, the root directory ("/") contains the core system files and configurations, while the home directory ("/home") is where user-specific data and configurations are stored. Allocating more space to the home directory can be beneficial if you anticipate having a large amount of user data, such as documents, downloads, and other personal files.

Your allocation of 100GB for the root directory and 250GB for the home directory seems reasonable, and it should provide you with a good balance between system files and user data storage. However, keep in mind that these are just suggested sizes, and the optimal allocation may vary depending on your specific needs and usage patterns. Adjust the sizes based on your preferences and requirements.

During the Kali Linux installation process, you will have the opportunity to partition your disk and specify the sizes for the root and home directories. Make sure to back up any important data before making changes to your disk partitions to avoid accidental data loss.
